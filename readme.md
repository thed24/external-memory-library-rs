## External Memory Library

This was a Rust port of a similar repo I wrote in DotNet. Both repositories were used and intended as ways to research reverse engineering and working with lower level concepts such as memory. See: https://github.com/thed24/External-Memory-Library.

This project utilizes CXX as a FFI bridge between the Rust code and the same DLL driver that performed the memory ready and write operations from the previous repository. This is, of-course, poorly written and was mainly used as a way to learn some new concepts.
